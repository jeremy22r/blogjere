        <section class="about">
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>Hello, my name is Jeremy Tinggogoy. I was born and raised in Manado, a beautiful city in North Sulawesi. My primary education began at SD Negeri Rerer, a school filled with wonderful memories and valuable lessons. There, I learned the basics of science, mathematics, and the Indonesian language, and developed my interest in science and technology. After graduating from elementary school, I continued my education at SMP Negeri 2 Kombi. My junior high school years were a time when I began to discover my identity and more specific interests. I became particularly interested in subjects like physics and electronics, which would later form the foundation of my career choice.<br>

                My educational journey continued at SMK Kristen 1 Tomohon, where I majored in Electrical Engineering. During my time at vocational school, I gained extensive practical and theoretical experience, deepening my knowledge of the electrical engineering field. I learned about the basics of electricity, electrical installations, and basic programming, all of which fascinated me. Additionally, I was active in various extracurricular activities that helped me develop leadership skills and teamwork.<br>
                
                Currently, I am pursuing higher education at Politeknik Negeri Manado, majoring in Electrical Engineering. My decision to continue my studies at this polytechnic was driven by my desire to gain more in-depth and applied education in electrical engineering. At the campus, I study various aspects of electrical engineering, ranging from electrical circuits and power systems to power electronics. I am also involved in numerous challenging and enriching practical projects and research activities.<br>
                
                In addition to formal education, I constantly seek opportunities to learn and grow through extracurricular activities and student organizations. I believe that the combination of theoretical knowledge and practical experience is the key to becoming a competent and competitive professional in the field of electrical engineering. In the future, I hope to contribute to technological advancements in Indonesia and make a positive impact on society through my expertise in electrical engineering.<br>
